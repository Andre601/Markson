## Markson
Markson (Combination of the names **Mark**down and J**SON**) is a library used to parse Strings into JSON TextComponents using patterns similar to [markdown's embedded links][links].

### Syntax
The syntax used in Markson is kind of similar to that of Markdown's embedded links, with some additional JSON parts.

Let's make an example.  
I want to display the text "Hey. Do you know Google?" where hovering over the word Google displays the text "Click me!" and clicking it opens the website google.com.  
In the normal JSON would the text look like this:  
```
["",{"text":"Hey. Do you know "},{"text":"Google","clickEvent":{"action":"open_url","value":"https://google.com"},"hoverEvent":{"action":"show_text","value":"Click me!"}},{"text":"?"}]
```

In Markson would this now look like this:  
```
Hey. Do you know [Google](hover:{text:["Click me!"]},click:{url:"https://google.com"})?
```

Doesn't this already look more clean?  
Color and formatting codes can also be used. Either as the original character (`ยง`) or as the `&` character.

### How to Use (Server Admin/Owner)
If you have a plugin, which utilizes Markson for their messages, will you only need to follow this formatting:  
```
[Your message here](options to apply)
```  
`options to apply` can be the following, available options.

#### `hover`
`hover` is used to add an action to the text, when you hover over it with your cursor.  
Currently supported are the following options:

| Option:  | Syntax:                | Description:                                                              |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`   | `text:["text","text"]` | Displays the provided String(s). Each separate String is a new line.      |
| `item`   | `item:"item_name"`     | Displays a specific item. Needs to be a valid item name (IDs don't count) |
| `entity` | `entity:"entity_name"` | Displays the defined achievement.                                         |

#### `click`
`click` is used to set actions that are performed when clicking the text.  
Currently supported are the following options:

| Option:       | Syntax:                 | Description:                                                                 |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `url`         | `url:"url"`             | Opens a provided URL when clicked.                                           |
| `suggest_cmd` | `suggest_cmd:"command"` | Puts a command (or any other provided text) into the chat bar of the player. |
| `perform_cmd` | `perform_cmd:"command"` | Executes a command as the player who performs it.                            |
| `copy`        | `copy:"text"`           | Currently not supported.                                                     |

#### Using both actions
You can use both hover and click actions in your text at the same time.  
Note that they do not need to have a proper separation, although using a comma is still recommendet.

## How to use (Developer)
You first need to get the latest version of Markson to use.  
We use [jitpack] to provide the jar files through Maven and Gradle.  
To install Markson to your IDE of choice, follow the below instructions:

> #### Latest Release
> [![versionBadge]][jitpack]

Please replace `{version}` in the below examples with the above displayed version.

### Gradle
Put this in your build.gradle file:  
```gradle
reositories {
    maven{ url = "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies{
    implementation 'com.github.Andre601:Markson:{version}'
}
```

### Maven
Put this in your pom.xml file:  
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
	    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		<url>https://jitpack.io</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.Andre601</groupId>
        <artifactId>Markson</artifactId>
        <version>{version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### Using Markson
You can now just get an instance of the `Markson` class and use one of its `parser` methods to parse a String.  
Note that the returned TextComponent is NOT usable in Spigot/BungeeCord and requires you to first convert it using the `JsonUtil`.
